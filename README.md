## asdfg
A simple GUI for `asdf`.

### Releases
[Released binaries](https://github.com/dwelch91/asdfg/releases) are tested on Kubuntu 22.04 and should work on recent Ubuntu versions (and maybe other distros?).

### Installation
- Copy the [latest released binary](https://github.com/dwelch91/asdfg/releases/latest) `asdf` to a directory on your `PATH`, for example, `~/.local/bin`
- Make sure the binary is executable: `chmod a+x ~/.local/bin/asdfg`

### Notes
1. `asdfg` expects the `asdf` binary to be located at `~/.asdf/bin/asdf`. There's currently no way to override this in the released binaries.
