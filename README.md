## asdfg
A simple GUI for asdf.

### Notes
1. `asdfg` expects the `asdf` binary to be located at `~/.asdf/bin/asdf`. There's currently no way to override this in the released binaries.
2. Version sorting attempts to follow semver in a sane way, but sometimes it doesn't sort the way you'd expect/hope. [Fixed in 0.0.3]

### Releases
[Released binaries](https://github.com/dwelch91/asdfg/releases) are tested on Kubuntu 22.04 and should work on recent Ubuntu versions (and maybe other distros?).
